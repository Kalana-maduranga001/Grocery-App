FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES
========================

Add these rules to your Firebase Console under Firestore Database > Rules:

--- FOR DEVELOPMENT (Testing) ---
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users full read/write to their own data
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

--- FOR PRODUCTION ---
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Prevent unauthorized access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}

STEPS TO APPLY:
1. Go to https://firebase.google.com
2. Open your project "amd-groceary-app"
3. Navigate to Firestore Database
4. Click on "Rules" tab
5. Replace existing rules with the development rules above
6. Click "Publish"

The error "Missing or insufficient permissions" will disappear once these rules are in place.
